# incidence2

**incidence2** is an R package that implements functions and classes to
compute, handle and visualise *incidence* from linelist data. It
refocusses the scope of the original
[incidence](https://cran.r-project.org/package=incidence) package.
Unlike the original package, **incidence2** concentrates only on the
initial calculation, manipulation and plotting of the resultant
*incidence* objects.

## Installing the package

You can install the released version of incidence2 from
[CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/) with:

``` r
install.packages("incidence2")
```

<div class="pkgdown-devel">

The development version of incidence2 can be installed from GitHub with:

``` r
remotes::install_github("reconverse/incidence2", build_vignettes = TRUE)
```

</div>

## Vignettes

An overview of **incidence2** is provided in the vignettes distributed
with the package:

-   `vignette("incidence2", package = "incidence2")`
-   `vignette("handling_incidence_objects", package = "incidence2")`
